# Microfrontends Example

This example shows how [`redux-dynostore`](/) can be used to dynamically integrate multiple microfrontends into a single parent application.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ioof-holdings/redux-dynostore.git

cd redux-subspace/examples/microfrontends
npm install
npm start
```

_Please note: unlike other examples in this repo, it is not designed to work in [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/ioof-holdings/redux-dynostore/tree/master/examples/microfrontends) and will require running locally to work correctly.  Also, due to issues when running a lerna monorepo within another lerna monorepo, this example does not bet bootstrapped if you bootstrap the root repo._
